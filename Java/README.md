  <p>
    The Triforce program is written in Java and utilizes recursion to draw a Triforce shape. It starts by drawing the largest equilateral triangle and recursively calls itself to draw smaller Triforce shapes within each larger triangle. The size of the Triforce shape can be controlled by adjusting the 'size' parameter passed to the 'drawTriforce' method.
