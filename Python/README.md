<h1>Can You Even Triforce?</h1>

<p>This program uses the Turtle graphics module in Python to draw a Triforce shape consisting of three equilateral triangles arranged in the shape of a Triforce symbol from the popular video game series, The Legend of Zelda.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Python 3</li>
  <li>Turtle module</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Clone or download this repository.</li>
  <li>Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.</li>
  <li>Run the program using the following command:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>python triforce.py</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Upon running the program, a Turtle graphics window will open, displaying the Triforce shape.</li>
  <li>The Triforce shape is drawn using recursive logic, with each subsequent Triforce shape being half the size of the previous one.</li>
  <li>The turtle's speed can be adjusted by modifying the <code>t.speed()</code> function call.</li>
  <li>You can customize the size and position of the Triforce shape by modifying the parameters in the <code>draw_triforce()</code> function call.</li>
  <li>Close the Turtle graphics window manually when you are finished viewing the Triforce shape.</li>
</ul>

<!--<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Here is an example of the Triforce shape generated by the program:</p>
